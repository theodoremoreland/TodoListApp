# Todo List App
A mobile application for managing a todo-list. The application was built solely for the purpose of practicing React-Native, TypeScript, and Realm. The application has a few basic features such as creating, updating, and deleting todo items. The user can also filter todo items by completion status (e.g. "completed", "overdue", and "open"). Additionally, the application sends out a push notification to the user when the task is due.
